Installation:

Note: These install instructions were originally from matlab.el and need some
      revising.

** matlab.el:

Put the this file as "matlab.el" somewhere on your load path, then
add this to your .emacs or site-init.el file:

  (autoload 'matlab-mode "matlab" "Enter MATLAB mode." t)
  (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.m\\'" . matlab-mode) auto-mode-alist))
  (autoload 'matlab-shell "matlab" "Interactive MATLAB mode." t)

User Level customizations (You need not use them all):
  (setq matlab-indent-function-body t)  ; if you want function bodies indented
  (setq matlab-verify-on-save-flag nil) ; turn off auto-verify on save
  (defun my-matlab-mode-hook ()
    (setq fill-column 76))		; where auto-fill should wrap
  (add-hook 'matlab-mode-hook 'my-matlab-mode-hook)
  (defun my-matlab-shell-mode-hook ()
	'())
  (add-hook 'matlab-shell-mode-hook 'my-matlab-shell-mode-hook)

Please read the mode help for matlab-mode for additional
configuration options.

Syntax highlighting:
  To get font-lock try adding this for older emacsen:
    (font-lock-mode 1)
  Or for newer versions of Emacs:
    (global-font-lock-mode t)
  To get hilit19 support try adding:
    (matlab-mode-hilit)

This package requires easymenu, tempo, and derived.
This package will optionally use custom, shell, and gud.
This package supports language specific extensions in imenu, func-menu,
     speedbar, font-lock, and hilit19.



** mlint.el

To use mlint with matlab-mode, add the following lines to your .emacs
file.

(autoload 'mlint-minor-mode "mlint" nil t)
(add-hook 'matlab-mode-hook (lambda () (mlint-minor-mode 1)))

This requires Emacs version 21.x or later or XEmacs version 21.x or later.
This requires mlint, a part of MATLAB 7.0 (R14)
This requires matlab.el
This requires eieio version 0.18 or later.
     EIEIO 0.17 will work and has poor color choice which can be customized.
     EIEIO 0.17 is currently an XEmacs package eieio-1.03 or newer
           OR XEmacs sumo package Sept. 2002 or newer.
     Newer versions of EIEIO are a part of CEDET.  See:

** tlc.el

To use this mode, put the this file into your load path, and add
the following to your .emacs file:

  (require 'tlc)
or
  (autoload 'tlc-mode "tlc" "tlc Editing Mode" t)
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.tlc$" . tlc-mode))
  (setq tlc-indent-function t)
